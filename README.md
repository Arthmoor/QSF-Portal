QSF-Portal
==========

QSF Portal is a fast, secure, easily maintained web community portal written in PHP/MySQL. It comes with powerful forum and download modules, as well as lightweight CMS capability.

Want more from your site than just a forum? This package provided a "portal" site. The idea behind this is much the same as something like phpnuke or mambo, but not quite that sophisticated yet. There is a simple page creation tool which provides lightweight CMS style ability, and an included file downloads module to get things started. Other modules can be added to it with relative ease. Can also be used to upgrade an existing Quicksilver Forums board to a portal. Portal additions do not yet have proper language support.
