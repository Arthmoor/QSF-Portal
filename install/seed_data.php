[b]Admin CP[/b]
There you will find all the tools you need to manage your forum. You can create new forums, edit global settings, edit member details and more. It's a good idea to go to [i]Edit board settings[/i] to double check the settings there.
[b]Control Panel[/b]
After you're done in the administration area you should take some time in the member control panel linked above. Go to [i]Edit Preferences[/i] to set your personal preferences for timezone, language and more. Go to [i]Edit Profile[/i] to set contact details and other information.
[b]Get people registering[/b]
If you logout you can see the forum as any new visitor does. You'll want them to register so it's a good idea to click the [i]register[/i] link yourself and see how the form looks as well as making sure it works. Registering not just helps you identify your members but also allows them to set their own preferences, profile and even subscribe to get email notices when new posts are made.
[b]Posting[/b]
This default forum allows you and registered members to create new topics, new polls and post replies to existing topics or polls. Topics allow you to start a new conversation. Polls are like topics but add the option of voting from a select number of options. Replies are where you contribute to an existing conversation.
[b]Formatting posts[/b]
Formatting is done via BB code. There are some buttons to help you along the way. When creating a new post select some text and press the 'B' button to make that text [b]bold[/b]. Use the URL button to add a link to your post. Click on a face on the left to add a smiley to your post. Feel free to experiment with formatting and pressing preview to see if it turns out how you expect.
[b]Getting help[/b]
