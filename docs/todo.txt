SUBSCRIPTIONS
Rework mass mailing in general to no longer use a 'bogus' to address while hiding all the receipients in the BCC field

MOD CP
Break down admin cp into smaller bits so user groups can be granted small access such as 'ban users' or 'create forum' without having super user access

DATABASES
seperate mysql specific queries so we can add support for other databases

DOCUMENTATION
More. More! MORE! <--- THIS!
