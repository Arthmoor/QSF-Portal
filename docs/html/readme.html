<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
 1. Upload all files, overwriting any existing files
</p>
<p>

  or, if you have problems, 777.
</p>

	<blockquote>
	/databases/

<p>
 3. Go to the install directory in your browser
 4. Follow the instructions
 5. Delete the install directory
</p>
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<p>
 Upgrading is done in the same way as installing. Make sure you select the
 "upgrade" option. Before upgrading, make a note of your current MercuryBoard
 or Quicksilver Forums installation version: you will need it to correctly
 upgrade.
</p>
<p>
 It is recommended you keep old settings.php. Do not overwrite it as you do
 with  other files
</p>
<p>
 Please note on upgrading the upgrade script will set the skin to default
 (previously known as Candy Corn) for all administrators. This is so you can
 still login and access Admin CP. Many templates have been added so any
 skins for Mercuryboard 1.1.4 or older will need significant changes.
 See <a href="http://quicksilverforums.com">http://quicksilverforums.com</a> for more information
</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>
 Quicksilver Forums works with PHP 4.3.0 or higher. PHP 5 is also supported.
 MySQL 3.22 or higher is required. Quicksilver Forums works on any operating
 system and web server combination.
</p>
<p>
 If you experience a problem and you meet these requirements, please report it
 as a bug. The latest versions of PHP and MySQL are recommended to keep
 Quicksilver Forums running its fastest and safest.
